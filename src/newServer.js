/* Module Imports
- We're using require() rather than import syntax as we are using CommonJS for Node.JS rather than ES Modules, the latter more commonly used in browsers / React etc according to ECMAScript 2015.
- express: this is how we declare our app as an express server with app = express(), populated by the express server methods like .use(), .post(). 
  - .post() declares logic for how our server RESPONSDS to a POST method http request.
    - It needs a minimum of two arguments, the first being the path on which the POST request will be received, the second being a reference to a handler functionâ€”i.e. what should be done in response to the POST request.
    - When there are three arguments given the second refers to the middleware. Middleware can change the res & req objects passed to the next function. The default res object contains methods the handler fn can use to response to the http request.
- bodyParser: the middleware we use to parse the data. Parses the data of the req object.
  -   bodyParser.json({ type: "application/json" })
    - converts the raw data of the req.body to JSON javascript object if matches the type header
  -   bodyParser.raw({ type: "application/json" })
    - leaves the raw data of the req.body as is if it matches the type header 
- stripePackage for loading our stripe package
- cors = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing:
  - Middleware security protocol which allows servers to specify who can access their assets and under what conditions. */

/* .use() method:
    - Used to apply middleware to any or all of the routes to be declared later with .post
    - If no route given, the middleware is applied universally, as in our use case.
    - If our req object doesn't meet the criteria of the CORS middleware then the CORS middleware changes the headers such that the browser itself doesn't allow the client-side javascript to process the reponse data object. The data still passes through the logic of our server (I think) */

/* Payment Intent Functionality: 
    - Payment Intents is the core functionality by which Stripe payments are created and processed.
    - Our client-side JS sends a payment intent request to our Express server. The data package simply contains the amount of the payment. It is sent by the client-side js to our /create-payment-intent path.
    - Our createPaymentIntent function sends our secretStripeKey and the amount to the Stripe server. Doing so creates a Payment Intent object on their server which includes a Client Secret Key.
    - The Client Secret Key is essentially the reference to the payment intent, which exists on the Stripe server, not on our Express server.
    - Our Express server responds to the client-side js by sending the Client Secret Key. 
    - With the Client Secret Key, the client-side js communicates with the Stripe server to actuate the payment. 
    - The only functionality that strictly requires the Express server is the creation of the payment intent. */
