## Skincare & Haircare eCommerce website
      
eCommerce website for a skin / hair product manufacturer. Featuring dynamic UX on header, footer and retractable menu elements, including animated discount code reveal. Landing page exemplifies brand identity: youth-oriented cosmetics with cyberpunk aesthetic. Interactive animated ‘cards’ expand to show ingredients used in products and act as links to product catalogue pages.

Modular animated card elements are passed data as props to exhibit each individual product. ‘Values’ page elucidates design philosophy and corporate/social responsibility commitments with full-page illustrations. Basket functionality retrieves data from React state mirrored to browser cookies such that data is retained on page refresh. A dedicated basket page directs user to checkout via Stripe.

All images generated with Midjourney.
